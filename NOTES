Z-layer output:
  are cell_kmin,cell_kmax useful here?
  currently all columns assumed full.
  need to be careful about cases in which cell_kmin/max are used
   to control what data to read (i.e. dwaq), and cases where they
   are used to control what data is present in the file but should
   not be shown (suntans)

  cell_kmin and kmax *are* used in ExtrudeTo3D.

  added a flag to say whether cell_kmin/kmax are needed (vertical_is_subset)
  easiest way to test for those would be to find a 3D variable with
    a fillvalue, and then just search for the fillvalue.

TODO:

 Make a vector variable out of the various component variables.
